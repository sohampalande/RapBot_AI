# RapBot_AI
Fine-tune the GPT-2 model on a training set of 40,000 lyrics from 1500 artists to generate new lyrics in the style of a given artist


Inspired by @Max Leander's medium blog post, I decided to create RapBot. I compiled a training data set of lyrics 
from various artists using the Genius.com API and then used this training set to fine tune the GPT-2 model. The 
model was trained for 2500 epochs.
